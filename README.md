Healthcare has always been a critical area for technological innovation, with automation and robotics playing an increasingly vital role in enhancing the quality of patient care and reducing the burden on healthcare providers. In this context, the development of MediBot—a robotic nurse in the form of a car—demonstrates the potential of embedded systems to address real-world healthcare challenges.
MediBot is designed to assist users in a home or clinical setting by integrating essential health-monitoring and assistance functionalities into a compact, mobile platform. This project leverages the PIC16F877A microcontroller to implement a system capable of operating in two distinct modes: a following mode and a medical mode. The following mode enables MediBot to autonomously follow its user, providing constant monitoring and real-time display of temperature and humidity. In contrast, the medical mode transforms MediBot into a stationary assistant, offering advanced features such as heart rate measurement using a heart monitor sensor and automated pill dispensing.
